Hi! My name is Anders Cornect, and I'm a Master's student at the University of Waterloo, currently pursuing an MMath in Computational Mathematics.

I am extremely passionate about math, research, and public speaking! I love having an audience and teaching others. This site contains all of my research, social media links, and a bit of flavour about me and who I am as a person. Enjoy!
