<p>
Hi! My name is Anders Cornect, and I'm a Master's student at the University of Waterloo, currently pursuing an MMath in Computational Mathematics.
</p>

<p>
In my research career, I have studied a wide breadth of topics in math and computer science, including graph theory, geometric group theory, algorithmic linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning.
</p>

<p>
This site contains all of my research, social media links, and a bit of flavour about me and who I am as a person. Enjoy!
