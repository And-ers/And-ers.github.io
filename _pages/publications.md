1. ## The Lamplighter Groups and Thompson's Group F have Infinite Weak-Cop Number [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996)]
   Anders Cornect, Eduardo Martinez-Pedroza

   # Abstract:
  The weak-cop number of a graph, introduced by Lee et al (2023), is a quasi-isometric invariant of graphs and hence of finitely generated groups via their Cayley graphs. While for any m∈Z+∪{∞} there exist graphs with weak-cop number m, it is an open question whether there exists finitely generated groups whose weak-cop number is different than 1 and ∞. We prove that wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. We also prove that Thompson's group F has infinite weak-cop number. The results are proved by defining two new pursuit and evasion games and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. In the case of Thompson's group F, we also present an alternative and more algebraic argument proving that it has infinite weak-cop number.
