1. ## The Lamplighter Groups and Thompson's Group F have Infinite Weak-Cop Number [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996)]
   ### Anders Cornect, Eduardo Martinez-Pedroza

   **Abstract:**
  The weak-cop number of a graph, introduced by Lee et al (2023), is a quasi-isometric invariant of graphs and hence of finitely generated groups via their Cayley graphs. While for any m∈Z+∪{∞} there exist graphs with weak-cop number m, it is an open question whether there exists finitely generated groups whose weak-cop number is different than 1 and ∞. We prove that wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. We also prove that Thompson's group F has infinite weak-cop number. The results are proved by defining two new pursuit and evasion games and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. In the case of Thompson's group F, we also present an alternative and more algebraic argument proving that it has infinite weak-cop number.

2. ## Gromov's Approximating Tree and the All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths Problem [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05338)]
   ### Anders Cornect, Eduardo Martinez-Pedroza

   **Abstract:**
   Abstract: Given a pointed metric space (X,dist,w) on n points, its Gromov's approximating tree is a 0-hyperbolic pseudo-metric space (X,distT) such that dist(x,w)=distT(x,w) and dist(x,y)−2δlog2n ≤ distT(x,y) ≤ dist(x,y) for all x,y ∈ X where δ is the Gromov hyperbolicity of X. On the other hand, the all pairs bottleneck paths (APBP) problem asks, given an undirected graph with some capacities on its edges, to find the maximal path capacity between each pair of vertices. In this note, we prove:
   - Computing Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with n+1 points from its matrix of distances reduces to solving the APBP problem on an connected graph with n vertices.
   - There is an explicit algorithm that computes Gromov's approximating tree for a graph from its adjacency matrix in quadratic time.
   - Solving the APBP problem on a weighted graph with n vertices reduces to finding Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with n+1 points from its distance matrix.
